## Dataent Video Functions

Welcome to the Dataent Video. This is the API list used for creating scripted videos. Using these functions, you can create a video for any application based on Dataent Framework.

#### Template

You can use the following starter template to get started. This template will launch the url `http://example.epaas.xyz` and login using the username and password. After that, it sets the speak voice to 'Samantha' (Only in macOS) and runs a few functions.

```
import { Selector } from 'testcafe';
import f from '../lib';


fixture("Test Video")
    .page ("http://example.epaas.xyz/login");

test('Template for test video on Dataent', async t => {
	
	await f.login('users@example.com', 'your-password')
	await f.setTestSpeed(0.75).wait(500)
	await f.use_voice("samantha")

//add video functions here, example.

await f.speak(`Hello World`)
await f.click_icon("Accounts")
await f.click_module_item("Sales Invoice")

})
```

#### Speak

Speak will generate a voice using text-to-voice functionality of your OS.

```await f.speak(`Hello World`)```

Ensure that you have defined the voice correctly in the `use_voice` function in the template section.

#### Go to Desk

Clicking on the home (E) Icon will navigate you to Desk.

`await f.goto_desk()`

For example, if I want to open New Sales Order from search, then values will be as follows.

await f.search("new sales or","New Sales Order")

Based on this, the system will just type the text "new sales or". Based on the typed text, it will select value "New Sales Order" from auto-suggest. With theses steps, new Sales Order will open.

To enter value in the data or date field, just write

`await f.fill_field("field_name", "your value")`

To click on a checkbox field, you just need to provide a field name.

`await f.fill_field("field_name")`

#### Click Form Menu

In the list view and form has a Menu button with options as Email, Print, Duplicate, Rename etc. To click on the menu button, use following function.

### Form Child Table

#### Open Row

epaas has many documents with a child table in it. For example item table in the transactions like Quotation, Sales Order, Purchase Order and invoices. If you want to open specific row of the child table, then this function will be helpful. Say we on the Purchase Order form, which already has one row added in the Purchase Order Item table, then write function as following.

`await f.open_row("items",1)`

Where items is a name of the table and 1 is the no. of a row in the item table which will be clicked.

#### Add Row

If a child table doesn't have any row added in it, then use add_row to add a row in the table.

`await f.add_row("items")`

#### Insert Above

If a window from the child table is already open, and if you want to add a new row on top of it, here is how to achieve it.

`await f.insert_above("items")`

#### Insert Below

To add a new row below the row open in a modal view, use:

`await f.insert_below("items")`

#### Close Row

If a table's row is open in a form of a modal, to close it, use:

`await f.close_row("items")`

#### Scroll to Section

A document is divided among many sections to increase its readability. If you wish to scroll to a specific section of the form, use:

`await f.scroll_to_section("Currency and Price List)"`

Where Currency and Price List is a name of the section.

#### Scroll to Element

Just like a document, other types of forms like module's home and pages also sections. If you wish to scroll to specific sections of these forms, other than the section break, you can use the following function.

`await f.scroll_to_element("html_element("Element Heading")")`

For example, following is a function to scroll to GST section in the Account module's home page.

await f.scroll_to_element('.section-head:contains("Goods and Services Tax (GST India)")')

Following is one more example of how to scroll to tax section in a document, which is actually not a section break, but an HTML element.

`await f.scroll_to_element("'.tax-break-up")`

#### Click Tree Node and Tree Node Option

To navigate in a master rendered in a tree structure, you can use following functions.

To click on the specific group or child node of the tree, write function a

`await f.click_tree_node('Sources of Funds (Liabilities) - Abbr')`

Where "Sources of Funds (Liabilities) - ABBR" is a name of the account.

Each node has various options like View, Edit, Add Child etc. To click on one of these options, use following function.

`await f.click_tree_node_option('Edit')`

#### Scroll to field
